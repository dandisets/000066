description: 'The reference space or brain template was constructed as a population
  average of 1,675 young adult C57BL/6J mice brains imaged using serial two photon
  tomography (STPT) for the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas. The average template
  was created from tissue autofluorescence detected in the red channel. To maximize
  input data and create a symmetrical atlas, each dataset was reflected across the
  midline, for a total of 3,350 (2 x 1,675) hemisphere datasets. Creation of the template
  followed a two-step iterative process: (1) We deformably registered each specimen
  to the current iteration of the template and computed an intensity average. (2)
  We then computed the average deformation field, inverted it, and applied it to the
  intensity average created in (1). This resulted in a volume with an average unbiased
  shape and intensity to be used as the template in the next iteration until convergence.


  The axes the average template volume is a +X=Posterior, +Y=Inferior(Ventral) and
  +Z=Right frame with the origin at the corner of the volume.'
